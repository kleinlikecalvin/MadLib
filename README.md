Me seeing if I have a grasp on JS so far

I am creating this JS project to test whether or not I have a grasp on JS so far. I am going to try to make my code as detailed and reader-friendly as I can.

I also want to try to use some sort of checking process that each user-input was utilized before the button will engage in generating a story.

Here we go!
